# Usage:
Input a list of minecraft seeds that you want to check in game. Then click "Load Seeds" to load it in. Once you click F6. It will automatically move your mouse cursor to specific coordinates and click. It will also replace the world name with the seed (because why not.)

# WARNINGS:
- Please use GUI scale 3 in game, i might make some future changes to be able to support other gui scales but for now only GUI scale 3.
- Dont use any mods/resource packs that heavily changes the UI. Although i did specifically made it compatible with the ModMenu Mod by making the coordinates it clicks on at the very edge of the button.
- Currently you cant change the keybind for Creating world and Exiting World. They are only set to F6 and F7 respectively. If you do want to change it, download the .ahk script and change the parts where i have commented where you can change it.
- Make sure the Minecraft version is set to the version you are currently playing on or some buttons will not work properly.
