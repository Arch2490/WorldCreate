# Usage:
Input a list of minecraft seeds that you want to check in game. Then click "Load Seeds" to load it in. Once you click F6. It will automatically move your mouse cursor to specific coordinates and click. It will create the world in less then 2 seconds (I think). 

It will also replace the world name with the seed (because why not.)

# WARNINGS:
- Currently you cant change the keybind for Creating world and Exiting World. They are only set to F6 and F7 respectively. If you do want to change it, download the .ahk script and change the parts where i have commented where you can change it.
- Make sure the Minecraft version is set to the version you are currently playing on or some buttons will not work properly.
- Before pressing F6, Make sure you can on the title screen. Might break if you are already on the worlds menu.
- Dont press the Tab key before running the hotkey. You can tell if it is pressed if there is a white outline even if your mouse is not hoverig over it.
- Dont use mods that add any new UI elements (eg, SpeedrunIGT, Atum, etc). The Tab-Enter might break since it would instead highlight those UI elements instead of the Singleplayer Button.
- Make sure you already have atleast a single world in your worlds list.
- I made the cooldown kinda fast so if you PC is slow it might lag behind and not fill in the seed box.
